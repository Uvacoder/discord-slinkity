      We're glad you care about your privacy as much as we do. It is our
      responsibility to respect and protect your privacy regarding any
      information we may collect from you across our website, lavean.co.uk and
      other subdomains of [.lavean.co.uk]. We strive for full transparency on
      how we gather, use, and share your personal information.




      Throughout this privacy policy we’ll refer to our website, products and services collectively as “Services”.




      ## Information & retention




      We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better with your consent.




      We collect information in two ways: if and when you provide information to us and from outside sources.




      We do not collect any personally identifying information through analytics services or other automatic means. When we do have any personally identifying information from either communication with you or by your submission, we will never share this either publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.




      We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it — which are described above — and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.




      ## Security




      All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted.




      We have implemented and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices (based on the nature of the information we collect) to protect that information from unauthorized disclosure. We will strive to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, however, no data transmission over the Internet, by wireless device or over the air is guaranteed to be 100% secure.




      ## Your rights




      If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:




      * Request access to your personal data.


      * Request correction or deletion of your personal data.


      * Object to our use and processing of your personal data.


      * Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data.


      * Request portability of your personal data.




      If you have questions about exercising these rights or need help, please contact us at mark@lavean.co.uk.




      ## Changes to this policy




      We may update this policy from time to time. If we do so, we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing you, if you are subscribed to our mailing list or by placing a prominent notice on our site.




      We also encourage you to frequently check this page for any changes to our privacy policy. Your further use of our website after a change to our privacy policy will be subject to the updated policy.
